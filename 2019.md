Codefreeze is an unconference with very little structure. Actually, it’s not a conference at all. CodeFreeze is a *time* and *place* for software craftspeople to meet. We would like to have likeminded people to gather in one place and have long conversations about craftsmanship over a beer. And to practice our coding skills.

While the core conference days are from Monday to Wednesday, participants typically spend a full week in Kiilopää to enjoy the amazing winter nature and amazing activities.

This year, we’ll experience new moon - time when the moon does not *enlighten us*, but hopefully gives more room for Aurora Borealis to do that.

Did we mention that this place is above the arctic circle? Which is pretty cool. Or *freezingly cold actually*.

## Why?

### Winter? Really?

Have you ever been coding under the northern lights? Or in a Lapp daylight? Early-mid February is one of the best times to see northern lights in action. And it also happens, that there's a full moon during the stay. We've done what we can - provide best possible time for some extraordinary experiences.

We know it might be rather cold. Temperatures down to -25 ºC are normal at the time of the year. For some clothing tips, visit [here](faq).

### Smoke sauna?

Being in Lapland in the winter, and one of the most important things is to have a decent sauna. And we do. There's a big enough smoke sauna to have probably up to 30 programmers. And possibility for winter swimming on a relaxing little stream.

### Want to relax a bit while coding?

Luckily, nature is at the core of Kiilopää. And not only that, Kiilopää provides daily trips to nearby fells guided by experienced nature guides. For example, there's a snow shoe trip on Wednesday morning.

### And what does it cost?

The prices are valid for the whole stay during the following duration 

The prices include *stay*, *breakfast*, *lunch*, *dinner* and (most probably) *smoke sauna* on Monday or Tuesday:

* For [single bed room](http://www.suomenlatu.fi/kiilopaa/en/accommodation/hotel-niilanpaa/): 86€ / day
* For [double](http://www.suomenlatu.fi/kiilopaa/en/accommodation/hotel-niilanpaa/) 64€ / day
* For a [wilderness cabin](http://www.kiilopaa.fi/en/accommodation/cabins.html) 97€ / cabin + 38€ / person / day for the meals
* For a [log cabin](http://www.kiilopaa.fi/en/accommodation/cabins.html) (very suitable for families): 112€ / day + 38€ / person / day


## Kiilopää: a magical place in Lapland

Kiilopää Fell Center in Lapland is an ideal place to get in touch with the Nordic wilderness. At Kiilopää you can conquer a fell, dip into an ice-cold lake, and ski under the Northern Lights. Or you can just sick back and enjoy the surrounding natural beauty, sense the arctic peace and quiet, and listen to exotic Lapland stories by the fireplace.

Kiilopää is owned by Suomen Latu, the Outdoor Association of Finland. Suomen Latu is a promoter of outdoor activities, an expert in hiking and an organisation which is open to all. The main objective of Suomen Latu has always been to increase Finnish people’s interest in exercise as well as developing possibilities for outdoor, conditioning and recreational exercise. Nowadays guarding everyman’s right has become more and more important.

### Have you done *The Dip*?

The Sauna World of Kiilopää is called Kuurakaltio. There are two electric saunas with dressing rooms and showers, as well as a traditional Finnish smoke sauna. There are separate sauna facilities for men and women.

Have you ever been winter swimming? It is an experience when the air temperature is around -20 ºC while the water is -1 ºC. You might want to dip into the refreshing waters of Kiilopuro fell brook. And if feeling really crazy, why not to take a fresh start in the morning?

During Codefreeze, the smoke sauna is heated on Tuesday on Wednesday, and on Tuesday we have a private sauna from 3pm-6pm.

*For more information about the smoke sauna in Kiilopää, [please visit here](http://www.suomenlatu.fi/kiilopaa/en/smoke-sauna/).*

### Spending some time at Kiilopää?

As folks found out on codefreeze 2015, the scenery is beautiful and there would be tons of interesting things to do, outside the realms of talking software. Suomen Latu Kiilopää organizes quite interesting set of safaris for all people. The possible safaris include, for example

#### Searching for Northern Lights

a guided trip with snow shoes to nearby fells in the late evening to see the fantastic Aurora Borealis.
    
#### On a Reindeer Trek

A reindeer caravan has been harnessed for you in the reindeer yard ready for your journey into the silent wilderness. Guided by an original Sámi reindeer herder, you will drive your own reindeer along the journey. The reindeer will take you across the enchanting snowy white scenery. The frost glistens like diamonds on the shoulders of the pine trees. You sit warmly and comfortably on reindeer skins in a sleigh. Reindeer bells gently ring as their hooves crunch through the snow. When the reindeer caravan returns to the yard, the experience of a warm “kota” awaits you. Enjoy some hot drink while a reindeer herder gladly tells you stories of his life in the wilds of Lapland. Transfer to and from reindeer farm.

#### Searching for Northern Lights on a Reindeer Trek

Reindeer caravan will take you in to the woods. Moon and stars will guide your way and the silence of wilderness will around you. Hot drinks and stories about reindeer in the kota after the sleigh ride. Transfer to and from reindeer farm.

#### And More

- Husky Safaris
- Snowmobile Safari to Wilderness
- Aurora Borealis Safari by Snowmobiles
- Fishing Experience by Snowmobile
