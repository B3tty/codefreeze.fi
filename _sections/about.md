Codefreeze is an unconference with very little structure.
Actually, it's not a conference at all.
CodeFreeze is a _time_ and _place_ for software craftspeople to meet.
We would like to have likeminded people to gather in one place and have long conversations about software craft under the magical night sky of winter Lapland.
And to practice our coding skills.

Did we mention that this place is above the arctic circle? Which is pretty cool.
Or _freezingly cold actually_.
