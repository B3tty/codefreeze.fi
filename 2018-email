Ok, dotting down a few topics:
- ask to state arrival / departure in Trello

The second most important thing FOOD:
 * If you have any food allergies and/or eat vegetarian food, please contact hotel: kiilopaa@suomenlatu.fi 
 to give them time to come up with proper food for everyone. Hopefully you all booked full board when 
 booking the stay - or you are knowingly doing something else (like cooking yourselves).

How to arrive to the venue?
 - a bus is driving from Ivalo airport to Suomen Latu Kiilopää (on all flights, waits for everyone to arrive)
 - add your time & date to Trello - know who to meet at the bus, or at the venue
 - depending on when most people arrive we well open the space, but the venue is so small that we will
   easily bump into each other. To identify attendees, look for people wearing CodeFreeze BUFFs

What to expect?
 - CodeFreeze is an Unconference which is nearly entirely run by you, the participants.
   Typically there are 3-4 days of conference mixed with a lot of outdoor activities.
 - We will start with a marketplace where everyone can introduce themselves and share the
   topics or questions they brought. Please add them to the Trello so everyone can 
   participiate and mark their interest by joining a card.
 - Because of the short daylight we focus on the outdoor activities in the morning (~1000-1500),
   the conference sessions happen when most are back. Please remember: you decide when the time
   is right for a session, an activity, a nap, or ... Smoke Sauna!
 - This is what you don't want to miss! On Monday, we have a private sauna only for us. 
   And there is a hot tub right next to the sauna - or how would you call water that might be 
   up to 20*C hotter than the air?

What to bring with you:
 * swimming suit / trunks (for the smoke sauna). This is, a surprise, a Finnish thing to have when on a public sauna. 
 And if you prefer the german way to be in Sauna, own towel might be handy, as there is 1 towel / person in cabin 
 or hotel room. But I'm sure you can ask for a spare if asked from the reception!
 * a nice and handy backpack, 20-40l. This is very good for day treks organised by Kiilopää
 * a bottle of 1l - a thermos would be nice if you have one. Again, for the day treks. It’s nice to have warm juice to drink.
 * warm clothes, spare gloves, etc.
 * a camera might be good, if we have a chance to see the auroras
 * cash: not so much - you can use credit card basically for everything in Finland.
 * Check out more interesting information on https://codefreeze.fi/faq/

WIFI:
 * There is wifi at the main hall. It might work at the hotel rooms, but not in the cabins.
 * Since we’re in Finland, a land with proper cellular coverage, there is a good 4G coverage.

All the best and see you soon!
