Hi all!

It’s only four weeks into CodeFreeze! Quite possibly the biggest so far.

*****
BRIEFLY:
Slack: Software Crafters Slack, channel #codefreeze_fi
Trello: <link to Trello>

If you have anything in your mind, please do not hesitate to ask!

Ok, dotting down a few topics:
- Schedule, duration (now full week), when do we first meet
- Link to Trello
- Planned Events add to Trello
- Communicate how to Join the Slack and find the channel
- ask to state arrival / departure in Trello

The second most important thing FOOD:
 * If you have any food allergies and/or eat vegetarian food, please contact hotel: kiilopaa@suomenlatu.fi 
 to give them time to come up with proper food for everyone. Hopefully you all booked full board when 
 booking the stay - or you are knowingly doing something else (like cooking yourselves).

How to arrive to the venue?
 - a bus from Ivalo airport (on all flights, waits for everyone to arrive)
 - add time & date to Trello - know who to meet at the bus, or at the venue
 - meet on Sat / Sun on dinner. Sun after dinner we could open the space (if all have arrived).

What to expect?
 - open space, market place in Trello.
 - outdoor activities during day time, conferencing later.

What to bring with you:
 * swimming suit / trunks (for the smoke sauna). This is, a surprise, a Finnish thing to have when on a public sauna. 
 And if you prefer the german way to be in Sauna, own towel might be handy, as there is 1 towel / person in cabin 
 or hotel room. But I'm sure you can ask for a spare if asked from the reception!
 
 * a nice and handy backpack, 20-40l. This is very good for day treks organised by Kiilopää
 * a bottle of 1l - a thermos would be nice if you have one. Again, for the day treks. It’s nice to have warm juice to drink.
 * warm clothes, spare gloves, etc.
 * a camera might be good, if we have a chance to see the auroras
 * cash: not so much - you can use credit card basically for everything in Finland.

Smoke sauna:
 * This is what you don't want to miss! On Monday, we have a private sauna only for us. And there is a hot tub right next 
 to the sauna - or how would you call water that might be up to 20*C hotter than the air?

WIFI:
 * There is wifi at the main hall. It might work at the hotel rooms, but not in the cabins.
 * Since we’re in Finland, a land with proper cellular coverage, there is a good 4G coverage.
